# data over sound


This code demonstrates a basic example of transmitting data over sound using frequency manipulation and binary encoding. It converts a given text into binary representation and generates corresponding audio tones. The frequencies for binary '0' and '1' are set, and the duration of each bit is defined. The resulting audio is saved as a WAV file. In this specific instance, the text 'How are you' is encoded and saved as a sound file.
